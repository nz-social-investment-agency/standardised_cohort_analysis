Title: enrolled in School
Author: Ashleigh Arendt
Peer review: Charlotte Rose

Inputs & Dependencies:
- [IDI_Clean_$(REFRESH)].[moe_clean].[student_enrol] - this can be generated as part of the school attendance code module
- max_date MOE student_enrol.sql >> [IDI_UserCode].[$(PROJECT_SCHEMA)].[max_date_MOE_student_enrol]

Outputs:
- [IDI_UserCode].[$(PROJECT_SCHEMA)].[defn_school_enrolled_$(REFRESH)]
- [IDI_UserCode].[$(PROJECT_SCHEMA)].[defn_school_enrolled_no_overlaps_$(REFRESH)]

Description:
Indication of whether a child was enrolled in school as indicated by moe's student enrol dataset.

Intended purpose:
Get base populations to calculate rates for children's interactions with the school system.

Notes:
1) The student enrol data should have been updated within 5 days of a student joining
2) We are including children who attend private schools in our base population where we have enrolment data for them.
3) Primary and secondary school ages are determined with the following logic:
	- If someone is in year 1-8 AND between the ages of 5-13 inclusive then they are assigned to primary school, 
	or else if they are not in year 9-15 and are of primary school age (5-12) then they are assigned to primary school
	- If someone is in year 9-15 AND between the ages of 12 to 18 inclusive then they are assigned to secondary school,
	or else if they are not in year 1-8 and are of secondary school age (13-18) then they are assigned to secondary school
4) Excludes 1 day enrolments as recommended by MoE
5) Concurrent enrollment at more than one school is possible:
	In some cases this is due to enrollment at an Alternative Education Provider or Teen Parent Unit that is hosted
	within a school - the student is enrolled at both the specialist school and the host school.
	In other cases this is because of differences in the timing of enrollment and unenrollment. For example, a student
	may change schools but the old school only unenrolls them several weeks after they enrolled at the new school.
6) Concurrent enrollment hinders straightforward calculation of duration enrolled.
	Hence additional work is done to end previous enrollments when new enrollments start.
	We take this approach rather than merging spells because it allows us to preserve education provider entity IDs,
	which are needed for confidentiality purposes.
	When tested runtime was only 30 seconds, so saving as View rather than table.


Parameters & Present values:
  Current refresh = $(REFRESH)
  Prefix = defn_
  Project schema = [$(PROJECT_SCHEMA)]
  Earliest start date = 2007

Issues: 
- Data quality issues for student_enrol prior to 2007
- There are some children with unrealistic school years
- Extraction appears to be annual in August, therefore will only be updated in October refreshes. Max enrolment dates (by complete quarter) for refreshes are below:
	202303 Q22022
	202306 Q22022
	202310 Q22023
	202403 Q22023
	202406 Q22023
	202410 Q22024
	202510 Q22025
	202603 Q22025


 Runtime (before joining to master) - 00:04:17
 Runtime (joining to master) - 01:58:59 

History (reverse order):
2025-11-06 SA cap open spells with max_date
2025-09-19 CR adding back in private and correspondence schools for better coverage
2025-09-19 SA revise to enable duration
2023-03-14 - AA
