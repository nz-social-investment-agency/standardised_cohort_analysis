Title: Maternal Substance Use
Author: Charlotte Rose
Reviewer: Simon Anastasiadis

Description:
This definition takes children born in NZ (still or live births) and looks at their mother's obseravble substance use before, during and after pregnancy.

The cohorts of interest are:

- Children under the age of five who have a mother with evidence of substance use at any time conception to th child's 5th birthday
- Mothers with child(ren) under the age of 5 with evidence of substance use at any time a childs conception to the child(ren)'s 5th birthday

We split this into 4 time frames:

- 1 year before pregnancy (i.e. 'recent' use)
- Prenatal period (conception to <28 days after birth)
- Early life (28 days after birth to 2nd birthday)

and a combined

- First 1000 days which includes the period between conception to 2nd birthday (prenatal and early life)

and 

- First 2000 days which includes the period between conception to 5nd birthday

Use is split into 
- Alchol use
- Drug use

and a combined

- AOD use (alcohol and or drug use)

The first three measures and susbstance type splits are primerily included for modelling purposes, and the first 1000 days is used for valiadation against published figures.

Our overall interest being 'any use in the first 2000 days' 

Substance use is defined by SIA's existing measures which draw from data from:
- Justice
- Health (hospital/primhd)
- Pharmaceuticals
- ACC
etc

Additionally we look at signals of in-utero exposure in hospital data and diagnoses of FASD.

Notes:
1) As birth date proxy is used, 28 days post birth is an estimate only.
2) Gestation (weeks) where available is used to calculate conception, however where this is missing, 40 weeks has been used as standard.
3) % figures for births between 2008 and 2017 were compared to a published study of maternal substance abuse in New South Wales.
	That study used health, child protection and mortality data. Our results are within one percentage point of the NSW results.
	While there will be differences in data and NSW vs. NZ context, this is reassuring that our results are consistent with
	the general pattersn observed elsewhere.

			% of children born 2008-2017 exposed to maternal substance abuse in first 1000 days 
					total children  	alcohol			drug		 	either/both
			NSW		970,470				13,637(1.4%)	23,485(2.4%)	32,647 (3.4%)

	"Powell et al (2025) Prevalence of maternal substance use problems during pregnancy and the first 2 years of life:
	a whole-population birth cohort of 970,470 Australian children born 2008-2017: pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40127908/"

5) Estimated rates of maternal substance use are generally higher than can be observed. 
In an NZ context it is reported that:
- An estimated 22-28% of mothers continue to consume alcohol after recognising they are pregnant with 12-13% continuing to drink into the 2nd trimester. (Growing up in New Zealand Study 2017 & 2018)
- 4.5% of pregnant women report cannabis use (2012/13 NZHS)
- Little is known about the prevalence of meth, opioid and other drug use during preganncy in NZ (See Maessen & Wouldes (2019) Parental alcohol, cannabis, methamphetamine and opioid use during pregnancy. MoH)

Parameters & Present values:
  Current refresh = $(REFRESH)
  Prefix = cohort_
  Project schema = [$(PROJECT_SCHEMA)]
  Residence year range = 2009 to 2025

Issues:
1) We are waiting for the FASD code module to be updated with new data tables. Once complete, the additional tables in the script can be removed (PRIMHD, socrates, gateway)

History (reverse order):
2026-01-16 CR changed intermediate sandpit table name to avoid confusion (it is ALL mothers and children, with a flag for AOD)
2026-01-15 CR updated definition to reflect definition agrred to by the Crown Response Office
2026-01-09 SA restyle and review
2025-02-12 CR v1
