/*
Methodology for finding maximum date for a source dataset
Simon Anastasiadis
2025-03-19

Logic is:
1 - Discard future dates as errors
2 - Keep only records within the last five years (to minimse impact of changes in data collection on calculation)
3 - Count number of records on each date (very low counts will later imply incomplete data)
4 - Compute threshold for low counts = one-fifth x 25th-percentile of count
5 - Discard records with count below this threshold (official collection ends earlier but some few dates occur later)
6 - Take the latest remaining date

The original approach for all max_date scripts, including this one,  was to make a view.
While it is fast to query the entire view (< 2 minutes for millions of rows) it is very slow to join/assemble the
view to the master table. This is likely due to how the base data is indexed (in columnstore indexes).
Hence we have converted this script and several like it to sandpit tables for performance.
