Description:

This script links people across child and parent/caregiver type relationships

The table looks at an individuals birth parents, birth parents' spouses and partners as well as any caregivers registered with MSD or WFF.

Intended purpose:

This table is intended to be used as a reference for indicators related to 'parents' i.e parent incarcerated, parental income, parent on benefit etc.
By including step-parents and caregivers we will get greater coverage of a child's whanau and current living situation than by using birth parents alone.

Notes:
1) Because the DIA data has inconsistant use of end dates, we use imputed proxy end dates for former marriages.
	This assumes someone can only have one partner at a time which seems reasonable.

2) Some parents have NULL end dates on marriages/civil unions (to people other than the other birth parent) 
	which occurred prior to the childs birth (with no subsequent marriage/civil union). 
	This may be true in edge cases, where is child is born to a partner who is not the spouse, however the 
	decision has been made to ensure marriage/civil union (to people other than the other birth parent) 
	start dates occur after a childs birth. It was found reasonable to assume that these spouses would be
	most likely to be in the role of 'step parent'.
	We also worked on the assumption that in the cases of donor and surrogate births, the 'intended' parents
	are likely going to be recorded with DIA in birth records rather than the donor/surrogate.

3) Some children many different parents/caregivers across their lifetimes. These children appear to
	be those who have had at least some involvement with Oranga Tamariki. 

4) Relationships are in spell format, start dates are the first record of the relationship, and end dates are
	either at the last record, the childs 18th birthday if they are now an adult, or left open. 
	Birth parents are always included as we have no way of knowing custody agreements etc. Any sole parent indicators
	must cross reference with other indications of singularity. 
	Future work could cross reference court ruling from OT data around custody.

5) End dates of '9999-12-31' are considered current

6) There will be cases where the birth parent is only listed as a partner for example: their partner is on a a benefit
	but they are not. For this reason, each relationship is queried both ways, looking at the birth parent as either
	the 'primary' person i.e. MSD benefit receipient and the partner
	of the 'primary' person, to ensure full coverage.
	
	
Parameters & Present values:
  Current refresh = $(REFRESH)
  Prefix = defn_
  Project schema = MAA2023-46

 
Issues: 

1) WFF start and end dates fall accross 5 different potential columns and as at Aug 2025 there was no clear indication
	of which was 'most valid'. The timestamp date is always filled so it is used as a fall back where the others are null.
	This is described in code comments when it occurs

2) We take the earliest start and latest end dates for DIA, MSD, and WFF. This means that there can be cases where administrative data
	shows a gap in connection between a child and adult but our resulting table shows no gap. For example, suppose Alice has Bob recorded
	as a dependent in MSD data in 2020 and in 2025, but not in 2021-2024. Our current method will report a relationship between Alice
	and Bob from 2020 to 2025.
	This approach is used because we seek to capture enduring relationships between children and caregivers, and it is reasonable to
	assume that relationships persist even if they are not observed in administrative records.
	One consequence of this is that children who shift between various caregivers over a long period may appear to have large numbers
	of concurrent caregivers.

3) Because people can be registered as a parent or caregiver across multiple agencies, there may be some parents with multiple relationship
	spells i.e. step-parents and caregivers. Future work could rank and merge these spells but in the interest of time and 
	taking into account current use cases, multiple rows of different spell types for the same parent/caregiver have been left in.

4) There are cases where dates are unreasonable e.g. parent died before birth, MSD start dates are before birth etc. these have been
	filtered out or otherwise controlled for.
