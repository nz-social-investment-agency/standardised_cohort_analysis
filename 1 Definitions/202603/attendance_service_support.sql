Description: 
-- This view identifies students who referred to the attendence service for truancy (code 32) or non-enrollment (code 9)
-- Including each student's intervention periods and the school they were enrolled in at that time.

Intended purpose:
-- Identify student referred to the attendance, with enrolment status.

Note:
-- Students with no matching enrolment data are also included because non-enrollment referrals (code 9) target those not
   currently enrolled. Excluding them would miss the group the intervention aims top help.
   (This is why we use a LEFT JOIN rather than an INNER JOIN for the enrollments table)
-- Some students are enrolled at a school even while an intervention for non-enrollment takes place.
	Best guess is that intervention starts while not enrolled or not attending
	but during period of intervention enrollment / attendnace is addressed, so there is some overlap
	between enrollment and end of the intervention.
-- Some students show no enrollment despite receiving an internvetion due to non-attendance.
	Non-attendnace would imply that they are enrolled.
-- End dates for interventions are NULL, 9999, and 1900 in the raw data.
	Best guess is that these records reflect inconistent handling of ongoing interventions.
	If the start date is recent (>2020), then such end dates are set to today's date.
	If the start date is older, then assumed end date was never provided and discard record as incomplete.
