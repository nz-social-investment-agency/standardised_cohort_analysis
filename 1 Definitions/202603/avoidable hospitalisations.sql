## Context:
This code defines spells where clients have had a publicly funded hospital event which is considered to be an Ambulatory Sensitive Care Hospitalisation (ASH) event or Potentially Avoidable Hospitalisation (PAH). This includes the diagnosis (ICD10 code) and the relevant ages for which it is considered an ASH/PAH event.
Ambulatory Sensitive Care Hospitalisation (ASH) conditions are health conditions for which adequate management, treatment and interventions delivered in the ambulatory care setting could potentially prevent hospitalisation. Ambulatory care refers to medical services performed on an outpatient basis, without admission to a hospital or other facility. 
A child specific PAH indicator was created under the Child Youth Wellbeing Strategy and include distinct ICD10 codes which are separate from the main ASH definition.
Potentially Avoidable Hospitalisations (PAH) is an indicator of health-related outcomes under the Child Youth Wellbeing Strategy and a Child Poverty related indicator (CPRI) required by the Child Poverty Reduction Act 2018. The Ministry of Health is required to provide PAH data as a part of ongoing annual reporting for the Strategy and the CPRI. PAH was designed to be used solely for children and there is no corresponding PAH indicator for adults.
The PAH definition includes hospitalisations that can be potentially avoided by:
* The provision of appropriate health care interventions and early disease management, usually delivered in primary care and community-based care settings
* Public health interventions, such as injury prevention, health promotion and immunisation
* Social policy interventions (such as income support and housing policy).
The expected business key for this spell dataset is one row per ASH event or PAH hospital stay, ICD10 code and version of ASH or PAH. For example, if a single hospitalisation includes 2 diagnoses (ICD10s) and there are two version of ASH, one of child ASH and one of child PAH there can be as many as 8 rows in the output data.

## Key Concepts
Both ASH and PAH are measures of the performance of the health system. They are NOT intended as indicators of whether treatment was appropriate or hospitalisations could have been prevented in any individual case. We expect some hospitalisations for each ASH/PAH condition even if the system is working optimally. For instance, of children with asthma, some may need hospitalisation even if they receive timely and appropriate diagnosis and care in the community. 
However, if the proportion increases over time, this may be an indicator that there is an issue with the availability of asthma management in primary and community care. (It may also indicate a change in other factors affecting asthma such as poor housing, circulating respiratory illness etc).
It should also be noted that a child who has several ASH/PAH events is not necessarily in poorer health than a child who has none. There are many serious childhood illnesses that are not part of the ASH definition.

## Key Business Rules

### ASH Definition
* The main ASH definition for ages 0-4 and 45-64 has been constructed from the description used by Ministry of Health as at 2024. This includes a list of diagnosis and procedure codes and the recommended age bracket for each condition. To get this list go to: (https://www.health.govt.nz/new-zealand-health-system/accountability-and-funding/planning-and-performance-data/ambulatory-sensitive-avoidable-hospital-admissions) and download one of the excel workbooks then go to the sheet 'List of ASH Conditions'.

### PAH Definition
* The child PAH definition for ages 0-14 has been constructed using the codes provided in Table 2 and 3 of The New Zealand Medical Journal article: Anderson P, Craig E, Jackson G, Jackson C. Developing a tool to monitor potentially avoidable and ambulatory care sensitive hospitalisations in New Zealand children. NZ Med J. 2012 Nov 23;125(1366):25-37. PMID: 23254524 (pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23254524/)
 + Ministry of Health have supplied an updated version.

### End Date
* The [end_date] in this table is the end of the hospital visit when diagnosis took place, NOT the date that the chronic condition ended.

### Data Consistency
* Consistent counts start in July 1999. 
* As at the June 2022 refresh the data for 2019 - 2021 are incomplete.
* Advice from MoH is that the hospitalisation data in NMDS generally has a one year lag. It is recommended that you look at the count of events over time to get a clear picture of the likely completeness at any point in time.
* It is likely that the end date of the reliable period will extend as the data is updated.

### Age
* Linking the [snz_uid] to [personal.detail] resulted in a number of individuals with missing birth dates. For this reason, the age of each individual was determined using the [moh_evt_birth_year_nbr] and [moh_evt_birth_month_nbr] from [pub_fund_hosp_discharges_event]. This resulted in no undefined ages. 

### Hospitalisation
* An individual can be associated with more than one ICD10 code in a single event. This may result in two or more rows for the same hospitalisation. 
* Note that a single stay may also include two events if they happen very closely together in time.

### Child ASH/PAH
* Most Child ASH and PAH codes correspond to children aged 1 month to 14 years (pg. 28, www.journal.nzma.org.nz/journal-articles/developing-a-tool-to-monitor-potentially-avoidable-and-ambulatory-care-sensitive-hosptilisations-in-new-zealand-children), however certain vaccine preventable diseases correspond to different age groups.
* In engaging with MoH they asked that we exclude anyone born in the month of the hospitalisation or the month before that. Note that it will exclude slightly too many people because the baby will be between 30 and 60 days old before they start counting. 

### Diagnosis Definition
* In some cases you may wish to limit the definition to only include the principle (primary) diagnosis. This is done in the where clause of the first query. Official stats only include the primary diagnosis.

### Exclusions/Inclusions
* Data limited to acute and arranged admitted events, and in some cases elective is included. 
* Non-casemix events excluded.
* Note that the numbers published by Ministry of Health exclude transfers so will be lower than the numbers in the module. There is ongoing investigation into this issue to see if it can be resolved.

### Import lookup tables:
1. Expand Databases in Object Explorer. 
2. Right click on $(PROJECT_DB) > Tasks > Import Flat File...
3. Find location of lookup table to be imported.
4. Provide a new table name (must be identical to names above). Choose the table schema (project).
5. Modify columns
* change data type for diagnosis_code and applicable_ages to varchar(50).
* change data type for start_age_mnths, end_age_mnths, and code_char_len to int.
Note that this will require the correct permissions for this table and user. If this does not work then another alternative is a BULK INSERT.

## Variable Descriptions
The business key for this spell table is one row per snz_uid, moh_dia_event_id_nbr, start_date and end_date.

|					|							 ||
| |moh_dia_event_id_nbr	 |A Ministry of Health generated internal reference number that uniquely identifies a health event. Notes: Can be used as a key to link publicly funded hospital tables. Therefore Event ID can be used to link between this dataset and the previous one (Publicly funded hospital discharges â€“ event information). Event ID is assigned by NMDS on load, so if an event is deleted and then reloaded, a new Event ID will be assigned.|
|					|							 ||
|Source				|source_type				 |Description of the source for the ASH/PAH codes.|

|					|							 ||
| |end_date				 |The date on which a healthcare user was discharged from a facility (i.e., the date the healthcare event ended). Notes: The event end date is also known as the discharge date. The [end_date] in this table is the end of the hospital visit when diagnosis took place, NOT the date that the chronic condition ended. For information about event end date, refer to the data dictionary: http://www.health.govt.nz/publication/national-minimum-dataset-hospital-events-data-mart-data-dictionary.|

|					|							 ||
|					|moh_dia_diagnosis_type_code |"A" is "Principle diagnosis" and "B" is "Other relevant diagnosis". The official counts only include events based on their Principle Diagnosis.|
|					|							 ||
|					|age_mnths	 |The patients age in months.|
|					|							 ||
|					|moh_evt_dhb_dom_code |The code of the district health board responsible for the domicile.|
|					|							 ||
