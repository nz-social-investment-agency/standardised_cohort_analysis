Title: B4SC
Author: Ashleigh Arendt

Inputs & Dependencies:
- [IDI_Clean_202603].[moh_clean].[b4sc]

Outputs:
Outputs include:
-- No record of check performed before 5
-- Check performed before 5
-- Check performed, evidence of no referrals for all tests
-- Check performed, evidence of referral for one of the tests
-- Check performed, no data for referral or otherwise

Description:
This code uses data on Ministry of Health's B4 School Checks (B4SC) to identify children who have received their B4SC check before they turn 5. 
These tests are across four different areas: dental, vision, hearing & growth, then two additional questionnaires are included: the Strengths & Difficulties Quaestionnaire and the Parental Evaluation of Development Score. 
This code is adapted from Oranga Tamariki definitions, with further advise from Sheetalpreet Singh <sheetalpreet.singh@health.govt.nz> from Te Whatu Ora.

Intended purpose:
To identify populations who are receiving their before school check, and whether they receive a referral for their check and get an indication of any future outcomes.

Notes:
There looks to be a potential delay with data becoming available in the dataset.

Max qtr of complete data id 2023Q2 as max date of complete data is July 2023 (for all check types)

-- Ages are approximate as we only have month not day of birth, so we check that the check occured before or on the day of the first month following their 5th birthday
-- The check date is sourced from 5 different dates in priority order: check_date (general date for a check), vision_date,hearing_date,growth_date, dental_date, sdq_date, ped_date
-- Referral logic:
	When someone has had a referral in any of the four tests, they are counted as a referral
	If they have evidence of no referral across all of the tests then they are counted as a non-referral
	Otherwise, we deem that there is not enough evidence to categorise them as they may have had a referral in one area that wasn't registered

-- Latest check date is July 2022
-- B4SC started national roll out in 2008, earliest available data is 2008-01-27, however in the data it appears the monthly figures don't pick up until March 2009
-- If our earliest date is 2020-04-01, then the oldest child who could have had b4sc would need to have turned 5 as of March 2010, so the oldest would be 15 years old in 2020-04-01
-- Comparison rates use all children in the denominator, 'in theory, all 4YO are eligible to receive a B4SC', DHB's send invitations to all parents with 4YO's enrolled with a PHO
-- The quality issues seem specific to the SDQ and obesity measures: quality issues with the SDQ tend to relate to teacher responses, so following advise from health we limit to parent responses
-- Coverage rates increase between 2009-2013 to reach over 90%

-- Ambiguity in whether to include 'Advice Given' or 'Declines' as non-referrals or unknowns
-- We chose non-referral for the former as health said usually this is guidance given by the practitioner which doesn't indicate they have serious issues
-- We chose declines for the latter as there's not enough informaiton to tell the outcome of the child


-- These B4SC are soon to change to be held between the ages of 2-3.

Max qtr of complete data is 2023Q3 as max date of complete data is July 2023 (for all check types)

Parameters & Present values:
  Current refresh = 202603

Issues:
- Many unknowns, sometimes check_dates occur with no information about the specific tests
- latest date for 202506 refresh in 202407
