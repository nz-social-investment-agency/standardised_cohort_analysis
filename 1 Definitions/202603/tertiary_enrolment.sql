Description:
Tertiary study includes the participation in one of universities, Te Pūkenga, wānanga, government-funded private training establishments and industry training.
This code creates an indication of whether a person has participated in tertiary study in a given time period, split by industry vs. non-industry training, 
as well as into part time or full time study for the 

A spell with any enrollment in tertiary education, regardless of source (tertiary education or industry training).
Seperate spells for part time, full time and both for non industry training (IT).

Intended purpose:
Creating indicators of whether a person is studying at a tertiary institution in a given quarter,
and whether this is part or full time.

Notes:
1) Writing a staging table (rather than a staging view) is faster as we can add an index.
2) [moe_clean].[enrolment] does not include cancellations/withdrawls. Hence it may overcount.
	Some withdrawl dates from courses can be retrieved from [moe_clean].[course]
	> Course withdrawls are used to shorten enroll times when all courses are withdrawn from.
	> Programme enrollments where all courses are withdrawn from before the course starts are dropped from results.
	> Withdrawls from industry training are not available.
3) When aggregating by region this will likely coincide with tertiary education providers (e.g. Universities Auckland, Wellington, Christchurch, Dunedin)
4) Metadata reports that programmes are constructed from courses, however method is not provided.
	To handle withdrawls, we join tertiary programmes and courses.
	This join is by person (snz_uid), provider, qualification, and date range.
	Provider and qualification are needed as some people can be enrolled at multiple providers or in multiple quals concurrently.
	Joining by date range requires course dates to be within programme dates.
	> Initial join used course overlaps with programme, but this produced duplication
	> If courses are used to produce programme, then reasonable to assume programme dates contain all course dates.
	There may be another column or columns needed for the join but we are yet to identify them.
5) Full time is prioritised over part time. If someone has both full- and part-time study they are recorded as full-time for that
   quarter (as they're essentialy doing more-than full-time).
6) Only type D courses are included (at least 1 week duration, 0.03 EFT)
7) Where nulls exist in the end_dates for industry training, the end date for the last year reported on for the individual and training provider are imputed.
8) As tertiary enrollment spells can overlap, when computing duration, need to use the merged spells table.
	As people can be enrolled with more than one provider at once, we take the min provider ID as a tie-breaker.


Parameters & Present values:
  Current refresh = $(REFRESH)
  Prefix = defn_
  Project schema = [$(PROJECT_SCHEMA)]



Issues:
1) Industry training duration of enrollment can differ widely from expected duration of
   course. We are yet to determine how best to reconcile this difference. At present we consider
   only enrollment.

History (reverse order):
2026-01-08 SA corrected handling of course withdrawls for early study end
2025-11-06 SA cap spell ends with max_dates
2025-07-25 SA Add merged spells for duration calculation
2024-05-09 AA Imputation for industry training end dates, removal of targeted training
2024-04-26 VW Updated to RDP refresh (202410), remove secondary enrolment, alter filters to add additional flags 
		      (part time, full time, any), filter dates to overlap with RDP quarters, remove spell overlap
			  condensing as only interested in if enrolled in the quarter (not duration) and want to preserve different 
			  spell types (part/full time) - replace with select distinct to remove some of these duplicate cases. 
2023-06-16 DY updated for latest refresh and incorporated join to master dataset for MT
2022-05-19 JG updated with provider code for entity count
2022-04-05 JG updated project and refresh for Data for Communities
2020-05-26 SA corrected to include secondary school enroll
2020-03-02 SA v1
