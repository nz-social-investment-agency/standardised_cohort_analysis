/*
Methodology for finding maximum date for a source dataset
Simon Anastasiadis
2025-03-19

Logic is:
1 - Discard future dates as errors
2 - Keep only records within the last five years (to minimse impact of changes in data collection on calculation)
3 - Count number of records on each date (very low counts will later imply incomplete data)
4 - Compute threshold for low counts = one-fifth x 25th-percentile of count
5 - Discard records with count below this threshold (official collection ends earlier but some few dates occur later)
6 - Take the latest remaining date


The 202506 refresh changed the structure of the corrections tables.
SA created a definition to reconstruct the major management periods.
However, because [directives] has future dates, neither [directives] nor our constructed table that depends upon it,
are well suited to max_date methodology. Instead we use the [muster] table.
